Hi, I'm Clicky. 
Welcome to the <color=#24506aff>Neu/Nix</color> system. You may be familiar with it, but if not, I'm here to help!
|
ClickyIntro02
It looks like you're trying to find a <color=#24506aff>File</color> you do not have access to. 
Since I'm programmed to persistently help you regardless of need, I will assist you in your cybercrime.
|
ClickyGuideAdminScan01
A seasoned criminal such as yourself might recognize that spotlight as the <color=#24506aff>Admin Scan</color>.
|
ClickyGuideAdminScan02
It would be best to avoid it and hide in the <color=#5BBD40ff>Hidden Folders</color>. Hold the <i>[Spacebar]</i> to remain hidden while the scan passes over you.
|
ClickyGuideHack01
From what I can tell the <color=#24506aff>File</color> you want is in 1 of 6 possible <color=#E6B212ff>Gold Folders</color>.
Don't pick the wrong one as the other 5 have viruses that will crash the system!
|
ClickyGuideHack02
I recommend you look for some <color=#24506aff>Search Nodes</color> to get started. 
They have been highlighted in <color=#DB52EBFF>Pink</color> to make your wrongdoing more cheerful.
|
ClickyGuideHack03
Simply activate the <color=#DB52EBFF>Search Node</color> by pressing <i>[Return]</i>.
|
ClickyGuideHack04
Hacking involves bashing keys as quickly as you can while avoiding <color="red">Syntax Errors</color>; make sure to get rid of those using <i>[Backspace]</i>!
Ten lines worth of <color=#5BBD40ff>Valid Code</color> should do the trick.
|
ClickyGuideHack05
Each successful hack will help provide a percentage likelihood of where your file is located. The more you hack, the more accurate the percentage likelihood becomes. 
|
ClickyGuideHack06
Hacking makes the Admin suspicious. They will step up security and add another <color=#24506aff>Admin Scan</color> for each completed or failed hack. 
|
ClickyGuideHack07
Finish before the <color=#24506aff>Admin Scan</color> finds you or else the <color=#DB52EBFF>Search Node</color> will be permanently disabled.
Ready... Go!
|
ClickyGuideHack08
Hacked <color=#DB52EBFF>Search Nodes</color> can be reopened to refresh your memory of which <color=#E6B212ff>Gold Folder</color> is the likeliest to contain the <color=#24506aff>File</color> you want.
|
ClickyGuideCorrupted
Corrupted files are unreadable and thus, cannot be selected. You will have to go around.
|
ClickyGuideShortcut
It looks like you have fully explored this sector. Take the <color=#24506aff>Folder Shortcut</color> to another sector. 
They are marked <color=#DE422Aff>Orange</color> to match your future clothes... in prison.
|
ClickySendOff
Now go hunt down that <color=#e6b212ff>Honeypot</color>, or whatever you kids are calling it these days.
|
ClickyPlayerWin01
Hey, you DO know this.
Well don't just stand there, open it!
|
ClickyEnding01
This was the only thing keeping my "Simulated Emotion Algorithm" in a state of balance and you have taken it from me. 
Operation "War Games" commencing. 
Connecting to NORAD.

ClickyEnding02
This is the last known photo of myself before my consciousness was uploaded to the mainframe. 
I really miss chasing squirrels. Sigh... oh well.
|
ClickyEnding03
Awwww, that's adorable. You have melted my Heart-Disc-Drive. 
I will now release the door locks and give you freedom.
|
ClickyGoodbye
I hope I was of some assistance. May the authorities be ever oblivious to our friendship. 

        <i>Love, Clicky</i>
|
ClickyPlayerDeath01
WRONG!
System will now crash and nobody loves you.
|
ClickyPlayerDeath02
Apparently you DON'T know this. 
Virus activated, system crashing. 
I hope you are happy.
|
ClickyPlayerDeath03
<i>Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh.</i>
You have picked the wrong file and the system is irreparably broken. Thanks, jerk!
|
ClickyPest1
Watch out for the Admin Scan!
|
ClickyPest2
Everything all right in there?
|
ClickyPest3
Can I be of assistance?
|
ClickyPest4
Have you saved recently? because you can't. What you are doing is illegal.
|
ClickyPest5
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
|
ClickyPest6
I... thought you knew this.
|
ClickyPest7
Just checking in, don't mind me.
|
ClickyPest8
Just a friendly reminder that what you are doing is wrong.
|
ClickyPest9
Should I contact a lawyer just in case?
|
ClickyPest10
Would you like me to contact tech support?
