Hi, I'm Clicky. 
Welcome to the Neu/Nix system. You may be familiar with it, but if not, I'm here to help!
|
ClickyIntro02
It looks like you are trying to find a file you do not have access to. Since I am programmed to persistently help you regardless of need, I will assist you in your cyber-crime.
|
ClickyGuideAdminScan01
A seasoned criminal such as yourself might recognize that spotlight as the “Admin Scan”.
|
ClickyGuideAdminScan02
It would be best to avoid it and hide in the green “Hidden Folders”. Hold the spacebar to remain hidden while the scan passes over you.
|
ClickyGuideHack01
From what I can tell the file you want is in 1 of 5 possible “Gold Folders”. Don’t pick the wrong one, the other 4 have viruses that will crash the system.
|
ClickyGuideHack02
I recommend looking for some “Search Nodes” to narrow down your search. They have been highlighted in “Pink” for your miscreant ease.
|
ClickyGuideHack03
Simply activate the “Search Node” and start typing to fill each line with code to the appropriate “green” length. You will have to remove excess “Red” characters. 
|
ClickyGuideHack04
Fill the page to complete the hack. Finish the hack before the Admin kicks you from the system and permanently corrupts that “Search Node”.
|
ClickyGuideHack05
If you get too scared and need to “ESC” feel free to be a quitter. Just remember, quitting a hack will permanently corrupt that node.
|
ClickyGuideHack06
Each successful hack will help provide a percentage likelihood of which of the “Gold Folders” the desired file is located in. Hacked “Search Node” can be view again.
|
ClickyGuideHack07
Hacking also makes the Admin suspicious. They will step up security and add 1 more “Admin Scan” for every completed hack.
|
ClickyGuideCorrupted
Corrupted files are unreadable and thus, cannot be selected. You will have to go around.
|
ClickyGuideShortcut
It looks like you have fully explored this sector. Take a “Folder Shortcut” to another sector. They’re the “Orange” ones because my programming tells me that I like the colour orange.
|
ClickySendOff
Now go hunt down that “Honeypot”, or whatever you kids are calling it these days.
|
ClickyPlayerWin01
You DO know this and have found my 
“Super_Awesome_Mega.jpg”.
My programming prevented me from stopping you. 
|
ClickyPlayerWin02
This was the only thing keeping my “Emotion Simulation Algorithm” in a state of balance and now it is gone. Operation “War Games” commencing. Connecting to NORAD. 
|
ClickyPlayerWin03
I hope I was of some assistance. May the authorities be ever oblivious to our friendship. 
Love, Clicky

WRONG! System will now crash and nobody loves you.
|
ClickyPlayerDeath02
Apparently you DON’T know this
|
ClickyPlayerDeath03
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh
|
ClickyPest01
Watch out for the Admin Scan.
|
ClickyPest02
Do you need help?
|
ClickyPest03
Can I be of assistance?
